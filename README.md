# TrafficTelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning  

TrafficTelligence is an advanced system that leverages machine learning to estimate and predict traffic volume. It integrates **YOLOv7** for object detection and **Hough Transform** for lane detection, enabling real-time traffic analysis.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🚗 **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv7 to detect vehicles and other objects in traffic.  
- 🛣️ **Lane Detection**: Uses OpenCV and Hough Transform for accurate lane identification.  
- 📊 **Traffic Volume Prediction**: Analyzes historical data to estimate future traffic conditions.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Insights**: Helps optimize traffic flow, urban planning, and commuter navigation.
